# 🌊 Flood Management & Prediction System

A modern web application designed to predict flood risks, visualize affected areas, and guide evacuation plans. Built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, this project aims to assist both citizens and authorities in making informed, life-saving decisions during flood-prone periods.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 **Flood Risk Mapping**  
  Interactive map displaying flood-prone zones with real-time risk levels.

- 🤖 **Flood Prediction System**  
  Machine-learning integrated prediction model to forecast flood likelihood based on environmental factors.

- 🛣️ **Evacuation Route Planner**  
  Suggests optimal escape routes to safety during emergencies.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React with Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Mapping:** Leaflet / Mapbox (assumed)
- **Tooling:** PostCSS, ESLint, Prettier
